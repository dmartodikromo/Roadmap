YAGNI stands for "you aren't gonna need it": don't implement something until it is necessary.

Why

-   Any work that's only used for a feature that's needed tomorrow, means losing effort from features that need to be done for the current iteration.
-   It leads to code bloat; the software becomes larger and more complicated.

How

-   Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.
