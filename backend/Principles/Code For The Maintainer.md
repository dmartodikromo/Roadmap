Why

-   Maintenance is by far the most expensive phase of any project.

How

-   _Be_ the maintainer.
-   Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
-   Always code and comment in such a way that if someone a few notches junior picks up the code, they will take pleasure in reading and learning from it.

-   Use the [Principle of Least Astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment).
